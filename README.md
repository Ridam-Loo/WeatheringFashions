# WeatheringFashions
Python code that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather in your location, and suggests clothing items from a local database based on the weather condition and current fashion trends.

In this code, we first import the necessary modules and set our OpenWeatherMap API key and location coordinates. We then make a request to the API and extract the temperature and weather condition. We use a dictionary to map clothing items to their suggested weather conditions, and another dictionary to map clothing items to current fashion trends. We loop through the clothing items and conditions, and append items to a list of clothing suggestions based on the weather condition and fashion trends. Finally, we print the list of suggestions.

Note that this code assumes you have a database of clothing items that can be accessed in your code. You would need to modify the clothes_dict dictionary to match the clothing items in your database, and modify the logic for accessing and querying your database as needed.
